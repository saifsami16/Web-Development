	<h3>Hennessey Venom F5</h3>
	<p>The Hennessey Venom F5 is an upcoming American high-performance sports car manufactured by the newly founded vehicle-manufacturing company Hennessey Special Vehicles which was established in 2017. The Venom F5 will be the first vehicle to be developed and manufactured in-house from the company including the chassis, body work, engine and exhaust system developed by the company along with other bespoke components. Initial reports had the Venom F5 powered by a completely bespoke and proprietary 7.4 L twin-turbocharged V8 engine; later it was revealed that while being still in development, the engine is to have an even larger capacity of 8.0 liters but the final displacement of the engine was revealed to be 7.6 liters. The engine is estimated to produce 1,600 hp and 1,300 lb⋅ft of torque. Pennzoil and Shell are partners with Hennessey to help fund the 301 mph (484 km/h) record attempt. The top speed is claimed to be 301 mph (484 km/h) through a V-MAX speed-tracking system, (311 mph (501 km/h) without limiter). Hennessey predicts the car will accelerate from 0–186 mph (0–300 km/h) in a time of under 10 seconds and from 0–249 mph (0–400 km/h) in a time of a little over 20 seconds.</p>
	<p>The available transmissions will be a 7-speed single-clutch semi-automatic transmission with paddle shifters, driving the rear wheels, making the car rear-wheel drive  along with a 6-speed manual transmission, both transmissions being offered as an option to customers.</p>
	<p>The chassis and body will be made almost entirely of carbon fiber.</p>
