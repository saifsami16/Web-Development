  <h3>Range Rover Velar P380</h3>
  <p>The Range Rover Velar is a British compact luxury crossover SUV produced by automotive company Jaguar Land Rover under their Land Rover marque. The fourth model in the Range Rover line, the Velar was unveiled on 1 March 2017 in London, England. The Range Rover Velar was first officially revealed in a series of teaser photos of 22 February 2017, and unveiled at an event at the London Design Museum on 1 March 2017. </p>
  <p>Although it is heavy at 4676 pounds, it’s more big boned. Literally. Underneath its sleeker, low-roof take on Range Rover’s signature rectilinear styling sits the same plus-size architecture that underpins Jaguar’s F-Pace. However, Land Rover tunes most of the Jag’s athleticism out of the chassis, although we’re okay with that, particularly on a luxury-minded SUV. Still, the Velar’s ride could be softened just a smudge further to match the handling relaxed vibe.</p>
  <p>Perhaps the Velar’s greatest trick is that it doesn’t sacrifice practicality on the altar of style. Although the interior isn’t as cavernous as the Velar’s exterior dimensions suggest, it is useful and roomy. Thanks in part to the ample rear overhang, there is a class-leading 34 cubic feet of cargo space behind the second-row seats. And Land Rover even cleverly installs a switch in the cargo area for lowering the air suspension, helping to mitigate the Velar’s somewhat high lift-over height.</p>

  <h3>Bentley Continental GT V8 S</h3>
  <p>The Continental GT V8 S is a version of the Continental GT V8 with increased engine power to 528 PS  at 6,000 rpm and 680 N⋅m (502 lb⋅ft) of torque at 1,700 rpm. It also features increased agility and body control to match the engine's higher output, lowered suspension through an aerodynamic front splitter. This arresting Bentley is a head-swivellingly stunning car. It arrives with quiet menace, like a killer whale drifting into a pool of wet-eyed baby seals. Its vast sculpted flanks, 20in double-spoke alloys with glinting brake calipers and little rimless headlights mean it oozes a sort of louche danger. It stands out in a crowd like a mafia don at a Women’s Institute craft evening.</p>
  <p>And that’s all before you even turn the engine on. Beneath the bulging bonnet idles a 4-litre, twin-turbocharged V8 engine that bangs out 521bhp. It’s so powerful it will push this car, which when loaded with luggage and four occupants weighs the best part of three tonnes, to a top speed of 191mph (although you do have to shut the roof at that speed – its coupe sister pips it by managing 192mph). Both cars rocket from zero to 60mph in 4.5 seconds. The power arrives in such an overwhelming and unstoppable flood – it sweeps over you like a waterfall over a rock shelf – that it makes you gasp. And the noise… It’s so deep, so shudderingly resonant, that you imagine they must have tuned into a 64ft organ pipe from the nearest cathedral.</p>

  <h3>Mercedes-Maybach S 650</h3>
  <p>The story of the Maybach dates back as far as 1909 first creating engines for Zeppelins (blimp) and later evolved into other purpose-built power-plants, and eventually the automotive realm in the late 1930’s. They even supplied engines for German tanks during the Second World War but never ceasing the automotive approach to introduce famed vehicles like the Maybach 42. Mercedes-Benz had interest and absorbed the brand and ultimately bringing us what many of us famously remember as the Maybach 57 and 62 during the early 2000s carrying a rather hefty price tag. Now, keeping the Maybach name alive, Mercedes moves the unique vehicle even closer to its latest S Class W222 chassis, which when wearing the Maybach badge is for all intents and purposes, a long-wheelbase variation of the S Class that otherwise only comes in one wheelbase for all normal S Class variations outside of the Maybach branding. Receiving a refresh for the 2018 model year, the Mercedes-Maybach S650 with its turbocharged V12 engine and 40 inches of rear legroom, divides its front and rear seating up in nearly equal portions where the rear outboard seats feature 12-way power adjustments, heating/cooling, massaging features, and a full array of infotainment and vehicle controls through the two-remote-controlled rear seat entertainment screens. The confines of the rear are accentuated by soft perforated leather surfaces, leather recliners, and enough color-configurable ambient lighting to put Gulfstream’s latest G-Class cabin to shame.</p>
